## Demonstration of Project Design and Diagramming

# Monte Carlo Radiation Transport

## Introduction

This repository serves to demonstrate some artifacts of the design process for
a scientific software project.

The physics problem that is to be solved by this project is Monte Carlo
radiation transport, a stochastic approach to modeling radiation transport in
a domain.  A large number of individual particle histories are simulated, each
following a different path based on random sampling of the physical processes
encountered by each particle.  The mean behavior of those particles is
recorded to estimate the overall radiation fields.

## Software Diagram

Making progress on a software project is easier when the project has been
decomposed into a set of small components with well-defined interfaces.  A
software diagram is an extremely useful tool for achieving this decomposition.
A software diagram can take many forms, from a block diagram in a visual
software package to a text-based outline.  The latter is most effective for a
markdown file such as this.

* Define domain & source
* Loop over many histories
  * Sample source characteristics
    * Sample position
      * assign fixed point source position (for now)
    * Sample direction
      * sample an angle from an isotropic distribution in 4*pi (for now)
    * Sample energy
      * assign fixed energy (for now)
  * Repeat until history is terminated
    * Look up mean free path for current material and particle energy
    * Sample distance to nuclear interaction
      * Calculate distance in units of mean free path
    * Calculate distance to boundary
      * Initialize min(distance to surface)
      * Loop over bounding surfaces
        * Calculate distance to surface
        * Update min(distance to surface)
        * Store surface with min(distance to surface)
      * Convert min(distance to surface) to mean free paths
    * Determine if next event is interaction or boundary crossing
      * For boundary crossing - record which boundary
      * For interaction - update direction & energy
        * Sample an agle from isotropic distribution in 4*pi
        * Calculate a new energy from initial energy & direction and new direction
          * return initial energy (for now)
    * Update position
    * Record contributions to tallies
    * Check for termination conditions
