## Initial Refinement

From the [first pass](first-pass.md) diagram, it is useful to refine it and
add detail at each layer.  Refinement of this diagram is often best
accomplished in a nearly "depth-first" approach.  Take block from the coarse
diagram and define all the blocks necessary to achieve that block, and then
one of those blocks can be refined, and so on.

Let's begin refining the "Sample source characteristics" block in the coarse
diagram:

* Sample source characteristics
  * Sample position
  * Sample direction
  * Sample energy
